This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

### Task 1

Try executing the code "chunk" below, which adds the number 3 to itself, by clicking the *Run* button (the green triangle in the upper right of chunk) or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter* (*Ctrl+Shift+Enter* on Windows) at the same time. The output should appear immediately below the chunk. 

```{r}
3+3;
```

### Task 2

To create a final, finished product of your work to share with your partner, children, parents, grocer, or labmates, click the *Knit* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* (*Ctrl+Shift+K*) to create a PDF of your entire notebook. Note how, in the code chunk above, both the operation (`3+3`) and the answer (`6`) are printed as if they were run in an `R` console. 

### Task 3

Now, add a new chunk below. To do so, put your cursor where you want it to go and click *Code* > *Insert Chunk* from the toolbar or  press *Cmd+Option+I* (*Ctrl+Alt+I*). Type in your favorite arithmetic operation and try running the chunk. 

### Task 4

In the chunk you just added, change the `{r}` to `{r, echo = FALSE}` and re-knit the document. Then change to `{r, eval = FALSE}` and re-knit again. Hypothesize what these changes did. 

### Task 5

Knit the document and note how the paragraph immediately below gets knitted. 

Now remove the brackets ("{" and "}") from the following sentence: "The probability that 10 independent Bernoulli trials each with probability of success equal to 0.5 will yield at most 4 successes is `{r pbinom(q = 4, size = 10, prob = 0.5)}`" Re-knit the document and note how this paragraph has changed: there's a number there now. 

This is an example of an *in-line* chunk; instead of making a stand-alone code chunk, you are running `R` directly in the text. 

### Task 6

Cut and paste this chunk to line 7 at the top of your document. 

```{r}
options(digits = 3);
```

How has the printed probability in task 5 been changed?

### Task 7

Inspect the top of the `.Rmd` file. Find the 'Knit' dropdown menu at the top file, and choose the 'Knit to Word' option. Inspect the top of the `.Rmd` file again; what was added?
