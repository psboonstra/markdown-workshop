This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) document. 

### Task 1

Try executing the code "chunk" below, which adds the number 3 to itself, by 
clicking the *Run* button (the green triangle in the upper right of chunk) or 
by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter* 
(*Ctrl+Shift+Enter* on Windows) at the same time. 

```{r}
3+3
```

On line 7, change 'console' to 'inline'. Save the document *Cmd+S* or *Ctrl+S* 
and then run the chunk again. Now in addition to running the command in the 
console, the output also appears below. This is the default behavior when
running code chunks, and I find it obnoxious, so I always use `chunk_output_type: console`.


### Task 2

To create a final, finished product of your work to share with your partner,
children, parents, grocer, or labmates, click the *Knit* button or press
*Cmd+Shift+K* (*Ctrl+Shift+K*) to create a compiled version of your entire
document that should automatically open in a separate window. The current
setting will create an html document that you can open in a browser. Inspect the
knitted html file and observe that, in the code chunk above, both the operation
(`3+3`) and the answer (`6`) are printed as if they were run in an `R` console.

### Task 3

When you knit the document, some characters are interpreted as Markdown syntax.
Based on comparing this raw document with the compiled html file, complete
the following sentences to demonstrate your understanding of Markdown syntax.

  (i) Characters that are surrounded by asterisks (*) will be ....
  (ii) Characters that are surrounded by backticks (`) will look like ...
  (iii) A line that starts with one or more pound signs will create a ...
  (iv) Square-bracketed characters followed immediately by parenthetical expressions
  are used to create ...

Here's some perhaps non-intuitive behavior: change the '(iv)' in the
list above to '(v)' and re-knit the document. Does anything change?

In markdown, the ">" character indicates the use of a block quote, which will be
set off by indentation. You can include multiple paragraphs in a block quote by
putting a ">" followed by a blank line and then another ">" on the next line,
like this Haiku

> He is a genius:
> 
> Professor Zawistowski
> 
> But he's not funny
> 
> *Phil Boonstra*

### Task 4

Now, add a new chunk after this paragraph. To do so, put your cursor where you
want it to go and click *Code* > *Insert Chunk* from the toolbar or press
*Cmd+Option+I* (*Ctrl+Alt+I*). Type in your favorite arithmetic operation and
try running the chunk.

In the chunk you just added, change the `{r}` to `{r, echo = FALSE}` and re-knit
the document. Then change to `{r, eval = FALSE}` and re-knit again. Write down
below what you think each of these options does:

  (i) `echo = FALSE` results in ...
  (ii) `eval = FALSE` results in ...


### Task 5

Knit the document and take note of how the sentence below ("The probability
that"...) gets formatted. Now remove the brackets ("`{`" and "`}`") from this
sentence:

> The probability that 10 independent Bernoulli trials each with probability of
success equal to 0.5 will yield at most 4 successes is 
`{r pbinom(q = 4, size = 10, prob = 0.5)}`

Re-knit the document and note how this paragraph has changed: in place of the
formerly bracketed expression, there's a number.

This is an example of an *in-line* chunk; instead of making a stand-alone code
chunk, you are running `R` directly in the text. Add an in-line chunk to the
following sentence that evaluates a simple rational approximation to $\pi$

> The fraction 22/7 evalutes to ...

### Task 6

Highlight + cut the three lines in the chunk below (starting with the triple backticks 
and ending with the triple backticks) and paste it to line 18 at the top of your document. 

```{r}
options(digits = 3)
```

Re-knit the document. How have the printed probabilities in task 5 been changed?

### Task 7

Inspect the top of the `.Rmd` file. Find the 'Knit' dropdown menu at the top 
file and choose the 'Knit to Word' option. Inspect the top of the `.Rmd` file 
again; what was added? 

### When you are done

Compiling to html files is a bit clunky, and Word documents don't always look 
the nicest. I usually knit to PDF, but this requires a few preparatory steps if 
you don't already have a Tex distribution on your computer. Go to the 
*R Markdown Cookbook*

https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/install-latex.html

and follow Yihui Xie's instructions for installing the `TinyTex` `R` package

If you already have a Tex distribution, then browse the RMarkdown cheatsheet 
while you wait, which you can find here:
